# Tacti-Shot
## This is my Project for COMP3000 in Games Development Technologies. The name of the project is Tacti-Shot. The idea of this project is to make an easily incorporated package for game developers working on Real-Time Strategy games that allows them to incorporate an Xcom-style flanking system, including accuracy of each attack, as well as AI and pathfinding to control entities within the game.
