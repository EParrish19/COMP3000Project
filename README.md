# COMP3000Project
## This is my Project for COMP3000 in Games Development Technologies. The current idea for the project is a Xcom-inspired system to incorporate flanking, as well as accuracy based on it, into a Real-Time Strategy game.
## The name of this repository, as well as the repository itself, is currently placeholder.
